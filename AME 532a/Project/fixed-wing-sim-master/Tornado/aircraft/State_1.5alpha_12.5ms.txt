This state has been used to compute the coefficient matrices. 
Although... the velocity of the state does not really affect the coefficients (as is correct, it shouldn't), however, to make sure, a realistic velocity was chosen to compute the coefficients nonetheless. 
Alpha of course also doesn't affect the coefficients when doing alpha, beta sweeps.
