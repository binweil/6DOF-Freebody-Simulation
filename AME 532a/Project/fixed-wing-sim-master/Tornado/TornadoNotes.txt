
== How to get the Coefficient Data from an Alpha-Sweep ==

If you do an alpha-sweep, you'll get an output file <name>-Cx_alpha.mat.
Besides plotting data from this result file with the post processor option 7, sweep plots 4, you can extract the coefficient data contained in:
results.matrix.

To plot the lift coefficient, do:
plot(results.alpha_sweep,squeeze(results.matrix(1,1,:)))

Thus, lift coefficients are in results.matrix(1,1,:).

See resultplot.m for other coefficients (line 386 onwards).

== The results.matrix Data Structure ==

First and second dimension specify which parameter.
Third dimension are the sample values. Thus, the j-th sample entry is:
(see also solverloop5.m line 105):

results.matrix(:,:,j)=[results.CL results.CL_a results.CL_b results.CL_P results.CL_Q results.CL_R
